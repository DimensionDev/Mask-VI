## Brand Colors

The main color scheme of Maskbook is white (#FFFFFF) shape over blue (#1C68F3) canvas. This particular blue color is referred as "MBBlue" in this document.

If you feel hard to remember, remember that the eyes are always blue.

Unless particularly required by a certain situation, everyone is discouraged from using alternative colors.

If the logo must be put on a predefined background and the background color is similar to MBBlue. An white ring is expected to be added around the circle logo externally. The width of the ring should be **5% of the width of the circle logo**. If using the squircle edition, the width of the external stroke should be **6% of the width of the squircle logo**.

## Logo Shape Placement

### Principles

The carved-from-a-squircle **core shape** shall never be used alone. A canvas must always accompany the core shape. The avatar display area (square, circle, or squircle) is considered a canvas.

When displaying a Maskbook logo alone on a free canvas, the square edition may not be used; use the squircle edition or the circle edition instead.

### Square Canvas & Squircle Canvas

The width of the core shape should be **72% of the canvas width**.

When the environment has a specific border-radius preference for all squircle logos in the context (for example, a large post which displays a lot of apps by their icons), the border-radius should comply with the environment requirement. When there is no such requirement, the border-radius should be 10% of the width.

### Circle Canvas

The width of the core shape should be **60% of the canvas width**.

## Text Ring

The base variation should be used as an official symbol.

The with-ring variation should be used mainly for meme purposes and community purposes (for example, non-official user community chat group avatar).
