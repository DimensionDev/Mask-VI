# Maskbook-VI

## Introduction

This specification ([Webpage](https://dimensiondev.github.io/Maskbook-VI/) \| [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/DimensionDev/Maskbook-VI)) is the manual for anyone who needs to work with the logos of Maskbook.

Many useful assets are provided within this repository. The use of these materials should follow this manual.

## 1. Managing Colors

The main color scheme of Maskbook is white (#FFFFFF) shape over blue (#1C68F3) canvas. This particular blue color is referred as "MBBlue" in this document.

Unless particularly required by a certain situation, everyone is discouraged from using alternative colors. If you feel hard to remember, remember that the eyes are always blue.

It can be a good practice to use the white version when the background is black. But when the background is white, it is recommended to use the MBBlue version.

If the logo must be put on a predefined background and the background color is similar to MBBlue, a white ring is expected to be added around the circle logo externally. The width of the ring should be **5% of the width of the circle logo**. If using the squircle edition, the width of the external stroke should be **6% of the width of the squircle logo**.

## 2. Geometric Logo

### Principles

The carved-from-a-squircle **core shape** shall never be used alone. A canvas must always accompany the core shape. The avatar display area (square, circle, or squircle) is considered a canvas.

When displaying a geometric logo of Maskbook, either going alone or going as part of a combination, on a free canvas, the circle edition should be preferred, the squircle edition is discouraged, and the square edition is prohibited.

### Square Canvas & Squircle Canvas

The width of the core shape should be **72% of the canvas width**.

When the environment has a specific border-radius preference for all squircle logos in the context (for example, a large post which displays a lot of apps by their icons), the border-radius should comply with the environment requirement. When there is no such requirement, the border-radius should be 10% of the width.

### Circle Canvas

The width of the core shape should be **60% of the canvas width**.

## 3. Text Logo

The text logo of Maskbook is produced with the font [Campton by Rene Bieder](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/rene-bieder/campton).

Font-weight is Bold. Letter-spacing is auto.

## 4. Geometric-Text Combinations

Combinations may be used for better brand identity recognition.

The base variation should be used as an official symbol.

The with-ring variation should be used mainly for meme purposes and community purposes (for example, non-official user community chat group avatar).
